Join the fun at ETH Denver and claim NFTs by interacting with fellow attendees! Here's a simple guide to secure your digital collectibles just by using your email:

### Step 1: Interact with NFC Badges
Engage with others by tapping their NFC Badge. Each tap is a unique interaction that can lead to claiming a special NFT.

### Step 2: Choose How to Claim
After the tap, a modal will appear, giving you two options to claim your NFT:

#### Option 1: Use Your Email
Enter your email address to receive your NFT. This will also create your very own Email Wallet if you don't have one yet. Your NFTs will be accessible right from your inbox!

#### Option 2: Withdraw to an EOA
If you're already a crypto enthusiast with your own wallet, you can choose to directly withdraw your NFT to your Externally Owned Account (EOA). Just enter your wallet address, and your NFT will be on its way.

### Step 3: Confirm and Receive
Once you've made your choice and entered the necessary information, confirm the action. Your NFT will be minted and either sent to your Email Wallet or your specified EOA.

### Step 4: Transfer from Email Wallet to EOA (Optional)
If you initially chose to receive your NFT in your Email Wallet but later decide to transfer it to your EOA, you can easily do so:

1. In the Cursive app, find the NFT you want to transfer.
2. Enter your email address and the wallet address to which you wish to transfer the NFT.
3. Transfer it. You will then receive an email confirmation that it has been sent.

### Step 5: Enjoy Your NFT
Whether it's in your Email Wallet or personal wallet, your NFT is a token of the great times at ETH Denver. Show it off, trade it, or keep it as a mementoâ€”it's yours to enjoy!
